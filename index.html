        <p>A lost soul named simply "The Unknown" arrives in Hell, whereupon her memories, her voice, and her "song" is stolen, as Hell steals the memories of all who reside there, sometimes leaving just enough to make inhabitants suffer. Seeking to reclaim it, she goes to face the ruler of hell, The Red Judge, but was locked away behind an unbreakable Anguish Gate below the Hells. However, she is called upon and finds Paz, a talking skull who acts as the game's narrator, and whose power, his "pulse" that is the "rhythm of the universe", is something Unknown can harness as her own "song" to break through Anguish Gates and ascend through the Hells back to the Red Judge to reclaim her voice.</p>

        <p>Heading to the first Hell, Voke, Unknown and Paz fight their way through the demons and kill an Aspect of the Judge, weakening the Red Judge's power while restoring a portion of Unknown's voice and Paz' memories. Discovering Paz's survival after believing him destroyed, the Red Judge sends the armies of hell to stop The Unknown and her other Aspects to guard the other Hells. As Unknown heads to the second Hell, Stygia, and kills another Aspect, the Red Judge, after researching the Unknown, finds a prophecy that states that the Hells will fall when an Archangel is slain at the Infernal Throne by a Hellsinger. Determined to prevent Hell's prophesied doom, the Red Judge attempts the "Ritual of Spears" to bind Unknown to her will after she battles through the third hell, Yhelm, but Unknown resists it, causing the Red Judge to slowly become panicked as Unknown reaches the fourth Hell, Incaustis, and defeats another Aspect, convincing the demons that Unknown is the Hellsinger.</p>

    <div id="bg_parrafo"> 
        <p>Desperate to safeguard the Hells as per her orders, the Red Judge calls upon "the All" to send angels from Heaven to aid against the Unknown, which is agreed upon due to the chaos the Unknown is causing in Hell. Fighting through both demons and angels at the fifth Hell, Gehenna, and defeating another Aspect, Paz regains enough memories to remember that it was the Red Judge herself that personally took Unknown's voice, to take her music for herself and prevent Unknown's rise as Hellsinger. Despite this memory, Paz believes something is off about what the Red Judge did and that there was something missing to the memory. Noting that the angels also fear the prophecy, the Red Judge acquires their aid in subjecting herself to "Dissolution", causing the laws and reality of the sixth Hell, Nihil, to start breaking down, at the cost of weakening the Red Judge more. Despite the efforts of Hell's army and the next Aspect to keep the Unknown within Nihil while it is being destroyed and make her lost to time and space, the Unknown is again victorious and escapes, making the Dissolution for nothing.</p>
